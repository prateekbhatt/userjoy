/**
 * Local environment settings
 *
 * While you're DEVELOPING your app, this config file should include
 * any settings specifically for your development computer (db passwords, etc.)
 *
 * When you're ready to deploy your app in PRODUCTION, you can always use this file
 * for configuration options specific to the server where the app will be deployed.
 * But environment variables are usually the best way to handle production settings.
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE:
 *    This file is included in your .gitignore, so if you're using git
 *    as a version control solution for your Sails app, keep in mind that
 *    this file won't be committed to your repository!
 *
 *    Good news is, that means you can specify configuration for your local
 *    machine in this file without inadvertently committing personal information
 *    (like database passwords) to the repo.  Plus, this prevents other members
 *    of your team from commiting their local configuration changes on top of yours.
 *
